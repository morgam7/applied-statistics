    "## Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment I’m working through four problems that all use simulation to explore different ideas in statistics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lady Tasting Tea (Extended):**  \n",
    "   I’ll extend the classic experiment to 12 cups instead of 8, simulate the chance of guessing correctly, and compare the results to the original setup.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normal Distribution:**  \n",
    "   I’ll generate lots of small samples from a normal distribution and compare the sample standard deviation (ddof=1) with the population version (ddof=0). The goal is to see the difference on histograms and think about what happens with bigger samples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **t-Tests and Type II Errors:**  \n",
    "   Here I’ll run simulations of t-tests while changing the difference in means. I’ll measure how often the test fails to reject the null when it should (type II errors) and see how that changes as the effect gets stronger.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ANOVA vs t-Tests:**  \n",
    "   I’ll generate three groups with different means and compare running one ANOVA versus doing three separate t-tests. The point is to see why ANOVA is better when looking at more than two groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the assignment is about practicing simulation, interpreting results, and understanding why we choose one statistical test over another.  \n"

    "In this section, we replicate and extend the classic Lady Tasting Tea experiment. The original design had 8 cups (4 tea-first, 4 milk-first). By chance, the probability of guessing correctly was small but non-negligible. Here, we increase the challenge by preparing 12 cups (8 tea-first and 4 milk-first). We simulate this setup repeatedly by shuffling the cups, recording how often the participant could identify all cups correctly purely by guessing. We then compare the estimated probability with the original experiment, interpret its implications for statistical power, and reflect on whether one might reasonably tighten or relax the significance threshold (p-value) when moving from the original 8-cup design to this 12-cup version."

    "This task demonstrates the distinction between sample standard deviation (unbiased estimator) and population standard deviation (biased but lower variance). We generate a very large number of small samples (100,000 samples of size 10) from a standard normal distribution. For each, we calculate the standard deviation using two different definitions:\n",

    "We then plot histograms of these results on the same axes, using transparency to highlight differences. The visualization should reveal a small but systematic shift between the two. We conclude by discussing how increasing the sample size would shrink this difference, illustrating the consistency of estimators."
